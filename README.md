# Texas Bridge Data Analysis

## Overview
This Git repository contains the coursework project focusing on the analysis of Texas bridge data.
The objective is to predict the current condition of bridges based on various predictor variables using regression modelling.
The project includes exploratory analysis, regression line fitting, and interpretation of results.

## Introduction
This analysis is part of the ECS7024 "Statistics for AI and Data Science" module, specifically Coursework 22, utilising Texas bridge data.
The project aims to explore the predictive capabilities of selected variables on the current condition of bridges,
addressing the Texas Department of Transportation's management queries.

## Scenario
The Texas Department of Transportation seeks insights into the relationship between age, average use, percent trucks,
material, and design variables in predicting bridge conditions.
Regression modelling is employed to assess the predictive power of these variables and identify the most influential ones.
The report is intended for a specialist in metal corrosion at the Texas Department of Transportation.
The emphasis is on providing a clear understanding of data insights and processing steps,
with a focus on practical implications rather than the technical aspects of the code.
Any assumptions made are explicitly explained for review and potential modification based on feedback.
